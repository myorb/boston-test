Tables (pseudocode):

user {
id integer auto_increment,
name vachar
}

salary {
id integer auto_increment,
userId integer, # link to user table
dateofSalary timestamp, # date/time when user received salary
sum decimal
}

Task:
All tasks should be resolved by ONE SQL query (no php loops),
user name should be listed in results of query


a) Design SQL which lists user(s) with biggest total salary from April to November.
Show user name and overall salary amount

SELECT name, SUM( sum ) AS sum
FROM user
JOIN salary ON user.id = salary.userId
WHERE 
YEAR( dateofSalary ) = YEAR( NOW( ) ) 
AND EXTRACT(MONTH FROM dateofSalary )
BETWEEN 8
AND 11
GROUP BY user.id


b) Design SQL which shows users who haven't received salary yet

SELECT name 
FROM user
WHERE id NOT IN 
(SELECT DISTINCT userId
FROM salary
WHERE Year( dateofSalary ) = Year( NOW( ) )
AND Month( dateofSalary ) = Month( NOW( ) )
AND sum IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY userId
)
